# Privacy Policy for MaddyApp

**Last updated**: December 2024

## Introduction

MaddyApp ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Data Collection

**MaddyApp does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

All data you create within the app (such as grocery lists, todo items, and bucket list goals) is stored locally on your device only.

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database. This includes:
- Grocery lists and items
- Todo tasks and reminders
- Bucket list goals and dreams
- App preferences and settings

Your data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

MaddyApp does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not integrate with any external services that could collect your data.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device, there is no data to share.

## Data Security

Since your data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device's security settings. We recommend:
- Keeping your device updated
- Using device passcodes or biometric authentication
- Being cautious with device backups

## Children's Privacy

MaddyApp is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, and since we don't collect any personal data, this is not a concern.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

**Email**: [your-email@example.com]  
**Website**: [your-website.com] (if applicable)

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. All your app data is stored locally on your device and can be managed directly through the app or by deleting the app.
