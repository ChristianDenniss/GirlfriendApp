- Using a passcode or biometric authentication on your device
- Keeping your device's operating system updated
- Using secure backup methods if available

## Children's Privacy
MaddyApp is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, and since we don't collect any personal data, this is not a concern.

Your data is stored locally on your device until you:
- Delete the app
